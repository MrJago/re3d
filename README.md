## Intro
The aim of this project is to downgrade GTAIII ([re3](https://github.com/GTAmodding/re)) by replacing
parts of the game [one by one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) 
such that we have a working game at all times.

## How can I try it?
- This build requires game assets to work.
